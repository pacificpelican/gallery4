LoveBird can be used to create blogs, online stores, pages, and more.

### Setup ###
In order to install LoveBird, create a mySQL database and use the <code>lovebird4.sql</code> file included in the root of the project folder to set up the schema.  Then copy the code to the root of a web server, after changing the data in <code>/application/config/config.php</code> to reflect the details of your site.

When your site is ready, change the constant "DEFAULT_NEW_USER_LEVEL" in your project's <code>/application/config/config.php</code> file to 10 [or desired level], then sign up for your account (and have any other admins sign up) and then once you have done that lower the "DEFAULT_NEW_USER_LEVEL" again, probably to 1.  The levels for access of users can be adjusted in the <code>users_levels</code> table in the database.

After that you can customize the site to your needs.  Edit the views that present the content so it looks the way you want, and modify the controllers for your purposes: visit the [CodeIgniter documentaion](https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/) and the [LoveBird homepage](http://lovebird.pacificio.com) to learn more about how to build out your site.

#### Set up using [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) ####
> The lovebird4.sql file in the root of the directory is the database.  From Xampp you want to get to phpMyAdmin (if Xampp is running its phpMyAdmin install should be available at something like http://localhost:80/phpmyadmin), where you will want to create a new database with the name lovebird4 and then use the import feature to upload the lovebird4.sql file to that new database.  After that it may well work but you have to check that the database user and password in the application/configure/config.php match valid credentials in your Xampp mySQL server--MAMP creates a user root with password root for the whole db server but Xampp may have different defaults so you just need to make sure that the user and password fields match ones with permissions to modify the lovebird4 database.
So the best way is probably to go on phpMyAdmin and see if there is a root user already, and if not go to User accounts > add user account, and then put root in the user field and password field and then make sure to check 'check all' in the global privileges section before you create.  If a root user exists you could create a new one with a different name but just make sure to change the (dev) db user name in the config.php.

> To make sure your account is an admin account, after you have created it you can go into phpMyAdmin and change the integer [default 1] that corresponds to your user id (as found in the users table) in the users_levels table to 10 or higher.

> The LoveBird app runs out of the index.php in the root of the project.  In your server's settings, point the document root to the top level folder of the project.
